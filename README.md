# Personal site starter

This is a tiny, fast, accessible starter you can deploy for free.

## Quick start (GitHub Pages)

1) Create a GitHub account (if you don't have one).
2) Create a new public repository named **YOUR-USERNAME.github.io**.
3) Upload these files to the repo root.
4) (Optional) Put your custom domain in a file named `CNAME` at the repo root, e.g. `example.com`.
5) Commit/push. After a minute or two your site will be live at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`.

### Custom domain
- Add a DNS record at your domain for `www` pointing to `YOUR-USERNAME.github.io` (CNAME).
- If you also want the bare domain (`example.com`) to work, add an ALIAS/ANAME if your DNS supports it, or follow the current GitHub Pages instructions for A/AAAA records.
- Then in the repo settings, set the custom domain to your domain and enable HTTPS.

> Always follow the current GitHub docs for the exact DNS details. Providers differ and IPs can change.

## Edit the content

- Replace `YOUR NAME`, `YOUR-DOMAIN`, and email addresses in `index.html`.
- Drop a `favicon.png` and optional `og-image.png` into `/assets/`.
- Modify sections and cards to suit your projects.
- Styles live in `styles.css`; small interactivity in `script.js`.

## Local preview

You can just open `index.html` in a browser. For cleaner paths, serve with any static server.
